# UMN_thesis_template

This is a Latex based thesis template passed along by various astro-grads.  There's no garuntee it matches the UMN requirements. If you discover it doesn't, please update as needed.

I think the original version goes back to Peter Mendygral. It has been filtered through various grads and this version comes from Karlen Shahinyan, hence the creative filler text.
